# Testing-Flavours-of-Python
A simple project to test which flavour of python is faster.  
<br />

# Dataset 


# Step1: Using cpython
The first approach is to use the tradition cpython flavour to run the code.  
By running the program using cpython, the program took 0.84 seconds to run.

# Step2: Using Anaconda on VS Code
The second approach uses anaconda run on VS Code.  
This approach took more time than the earlier approach taking 1.86 seconds.

# Step3: Usimg Anaconda on Jupyter labs
The third approach was to use Jupyter lab to execute the program.  
This approach took the least time upto 0.03 seconds.

# Step4: Usimg PyPy
The final approach was by using PyPy.  
This approach took the most time of 2.41 seconds

# Conclusion
Thus we can conclude that from all the flavours of python used in this experiment, running python on Anaconda using Jupyter labs is the fastest.
