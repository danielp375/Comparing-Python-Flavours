# Testing-Flavours-of-Python
A simple project to test which flavour of python is faster


# Step1: Using cpython
The first approach is to use the tradition cpython flavour to run the code.
By running the program using cpython, the program took 0.84 seconds to run

# Step2: Using Anaconda on VS Code
The second approach uses anaconda run on VS Code. This approach took more time than the earlier approach taking 1.86 seconds.

# Step3: Usimg Anaconda on Jupyter labs
The third approach was to use Jupyter lab to execute the program. This approach took the least time upto 0.03 seconds.
